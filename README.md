## Overview

This project was developed using React as the main framework. For global state management, Context API was used, allowing the centralization of information related to searches and filters, which improves organization and facilitates code maintenance.

Additionally, the Axios library was used to handle API requests, ensuring efficient and flexible communication with external services.

## Areas for Improvement
### If more time were available, the following aspects could be improved:
- Icon Management: Implementing a library for better control and customization of the icons used in the application.
- Improved Icon Display: Allowing the Assets list to display multiple icons simultaneously when specific conditions are met, such as when sensorType is "energy" and status is "alert".
